# Ngabuburitâ„¢ Break Breaker Game

I'm learning canvas, and I made this game...

This game is ridiculously simple, I created this game and tweak it a bit with help of [freecodecamp canvas game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0) and this [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-JYwwXuO4Q).

Feature :

- Generate levels randomly as you progress
